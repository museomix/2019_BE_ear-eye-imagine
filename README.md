# Ear Eye Imagine
Ear Eye Imagine: an audio visualization made during MuseomixBE 2019 at Fondation Folon. 

## Design is how it works

This application is made with [VVVV](https://vvvv.org/) and was built and displayed on Windows 10 (64-bit). 
It was run on a laptop connected with a secondary display that was put in a exhibition unit. 
That unit had the appearance of an opened book. 
On the left page: an instruction for the visitor and a mic; 
on the right page: the display. 

A more in-depth documentation of the project is forthcoming.
